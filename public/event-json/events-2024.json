Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna. If due to some reasons one is not able to break the fast during Pratahkal then one should do it after Madhyahna.At times Ekadashi fasting is suggested on two consecutive days. It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha. When alternate Ekadashi fasting is suggested for Smartha it coincides with Vaishnava Ekadashi fasting day.Ekadashi fasting on both days is suggested for staunch devotees who seek for love and affection of Lord Vishnu."

      "2024 Chandra DarshanChandra Darshan is the first day of moon sighting after no moon day. In Hinduism, the new moon day is known as Amavasya and the first sighting of moon after new moon has religious significance. People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

This duration of forty Ghatis is known as Punya Kaal. Sankranti activities, like taking bath, offering Naivedhya (food offered to deity) to Lord Surya, offering charity or Dakshina, performing Shraddha rituals and breaking fast or Parana, should be done during Punya Kaal.If Makar Sankranti happens after Sunset then all Punya Kaal activities are postponed till next day Sunrise. Hence all Punya Kaal activities should be done in day time.DrikPanchang.com suggests Sankranti Muhurta which falls between Makar Sankranti moment and 40 Ghatis from it. We list this time as Punya Kaal Muhurta. Our holy scriptures suggest that 5 Ghatis duration after Sunrise (if Sankranti happens after Sunset on previous day) and 1 Ghati duration after Sankranti moment (if Sankranti happens in day time) are highly auspicious. If this Muhurta is available we list it as Mahapunya Kaal Muhurta. Mahapunya Kaal Muhurta, if available, should be preferred over Punya Kaal Muhurta.In Tamil Nadu Makar Sankranti or Sankranthi is known as Pongal. In Gujarat and Rajasthan Makar Sankranti is known as Uttarayana. In Haryana and Punjab Makar Sankranti is known as Maghi.Sankranti Punya Kaal is different for all cities. Hence it is important to set your location first before noting down Sankranti Muhurta.Whole team of DrikPanchang.com wishes you Happy Sankranti and Pongal."

Hence people offer charity to needy according to their capacity.The holy dip at Dashashwamedh Ghat at Varanasi and Triveni Sangam at Prayag is considered highly auspicious and important on Paush Purnima day. It is believed that the holy dip on the auspicious day of Paush Purnima liberates the soul from the continuous cycle of the birth and the death.Shakambhari Jayanti is also observed during Paush Purnima.

Ghatasthapana Muhurta is more popular during Shardiya Navratri but it is also needed during Magha Gupta Navratri.Ghatasthapana is one of the significant rituals during Navratri. It marks the beginning of the nine days Durga Puja. Our scriptures have well defined rules and guidelines to perform Ghatasthapana during a certain period of time at the beginning of Navratri. Ghatasthapana is invocation of Goddess Shakti and doing it wrong time, as our scriptures forewarn, might bring wrath of the Goddess Shakti. Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.The most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done during Abhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoid Nakshatra Chitra and Vaidhriti Yoga during Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited. The most important factor to consider is that Ghatasthapana is done before Hindu midday while Pratipada is prevailing.We also consider Lagna and try to include Dvi-Svabhava Lagna (द्वि स्वभाव लग्न) into calculated Muhurta. During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava Lagna Kanya prevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.The factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.Ghatasthapana is also known as Kalash Sthapana or Kalashsthapana.

      "2024 Chandra DarshanChandra Darshan is the first day of moon sighting after no moon day. In Hinduism, the new moon day is known as Amavasya and the first sighting of moon after new moon has religious significance. People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

Goddess Saraswati is worshipped on Vasant Panchami day. Vasant Panchami is also known as Shri Panchami and Saraswati Panchami.People worship Goddess Saraswati to get enlighten with knowledge and to get rid of lethargy, sluggishness and ignorance. This ritual of initiating education to children is known as Akshar-Abhyasam or Vidya-Arambham/Praasana which is one of the famous rituals of Vasant Panchami. Schools and colleges arrange pujas in the morning to seek blessing of the Goddess.Purvahna Kala, which is the time between the sunrise and the midday, is considered to decide Vasant Panchami day. Vasant Panchami is celebrated on the day when Panchami Tithi prevails during Purvahna Kala. Due to which Vasant Panchami might also fall on Chaturthi Tithi.Many astrologers consider Vasant Panchami as Abujha (अबूझ) day which is auspicious to start all good work. According to this belief whole Vasant Panchami day is auspicious to perform Saraswati Puja.Although there is no special time to perform Saraswati Puja on Vasant Panchami day one should make sure that Puja is done when Panchami Tithi is prevailing. Many times Panchami Tithi doesn't prevail whole of the day on Vasant Panchami day hence we believe that it is important to do Saraswati puja within Panchami Tithi.DrikPanchang.com suggests Saraswati Puja time during Purvahna Kala while Panchami Tithi is prevailing.

      "2024 Ratha SaptamiSaptami Tithi is dedicated to Lord Surya. Shukla Paksha Saptami in Magha month is known as Ratha Saptami or Magha Saptami. It is believed that Lord Surya Dev started enlightening the whole world on Ratha Saptami day which was considered as birth day of God Surya. Hence this day is also known as Surya Jayanti.Ratha Saptami is highly auspicious day and it is considered as auspicious as Surya Grahan for Dan-Punya activities. By worshipping Lord Surya and observing fast on this day one can get rid of all type of sins. It is believed that seven types of sins done, knowingly, unknowingly, by words, by body, by mind, in current birth and in previous births are purged by worshipping Lord Surya on this day.On Ratha Saptami one should take bath during Arunodaya. Ratha Saptami Snan is one of the important rituals and is suggested during Arunodaya only. Arunodaya period prevails for four Ghatis (approx. one and half hour for Indian locations if we consider one Ghati duration as 24 minutes) before sunrise. Taking bath before sunrise during Arunodaya keeps one healthy and free from all types of ailments and diseases. Because of this belief Ratha Saptami is also known as Arogya Saptami. Taking bath in water body like river, canal is preferred over taking bath at home. DrikPanchang.com lists Arunodaya period and sunrise time for most cities across the globe.After taking bath one should worship Lord Surya during sunrise by offering Arghyadan (अर्घ्यदान) to Him. Arghyadan is performed by slowly offering water to Lord Surya from small Kalash with folded hand in Namaskar Mudra while facing Lord Sun in standing position. After this one should light Deepak of pure Ghee and worship Sun God with Kapoor, Dhup, and red flowers. By doing morning Snan, Dan-Punya and Arghyadan to Suryadev one is bestowed with long life, good health and prosperity.This day is also known as Achala Saptami."

Bhishma bowed for celibacy and followed it throughout his life. Due to his loyalty and devotion to his father Pitamah Bhishma was blessed with boon to choose the time of his death.When he got injured in the battle of Mahabharata he didn't leave his body due to his boon. He waited for the auspicious moment to give up his body. According to Hindu belief God Suryadev moves in South direction during half of year which is inauspicious period and all auspicious activities are postponed till Suryadev starts moving back in North direction. Pitamah Bhishma chose Magha Shukla Ashtami to give up his body and by this time Suryadev started moving back in North direction or Uttarayana (उत्तरायण).This day People do Ekodishta (एकोदिष्ट) Shradhha for him. His Shradhha has been prescribed for those who have lost their father. However many believe that his Shradhha rituals can be performed by all irrespective of their father being alive or dead."

      "Maha Shivaratri 2024Shivaratri is great festival of convergence of Shiva and Shakti. Chaturdashi Tithi during Krishna Paksha in month of Magha is known as Maha Shivaratri according to South Indian calendar. However according to North Indian calendar Masik Shivaratri in month of Phalguna is known as Maha Shivaratri. In both calendars it is naming convention of lunar month which differs. However both, North Indians and South Indians, celebrate Maha Shivaratri on same day.Vrat VidhiOne day before Shivaratri Vratam, most likely on Trayodashi, devotees should eat only one time. On Shivaratri day, after finishing morning rituals devotees should take Sankalp (संकल्प) to observe full day fast on Shivaratri and to take food next day. During Sankalp devotees pledge for self-determination throughout the fasting period and seek blessing of Lord Shiva to finish the fast without any interference. Hindu fasts are strict and people pledge for self-determination and seek God blessing before starting them to finish them successfully.On Shivaratri day devotees should take second bath in the evening before doing Shiva Puja or visiting temple. Shiva Puja should be done during night and devotees should break the fast next day after taking bath. Devotees should break the fast between sunrise and before the end of Chaturdashi Tithi to get maximum benefit of the Vrat. According to one contradictory opinion devotees should break the fast only when Chaturdashi Tithi gets over. But it is believed that both Shiva Puja and Parana (पारण) i.e. breaking the fast should be done within Chaturdashi Tithi.Shivaratri puja can be performed one time or four times during the night. The whole night duration can be divided into four to get four Prahar (प्रहर) to perform Shiva Puja four times. Drikpanchang.com lists all four Prahar durations for staunch Shiva devotees who perform Shiva Pujan four times in the night. We also list Nishita time when Lord Shiva appeared on the Earth in the form of Linga and the time window to break the fast on next day.Shivaratri is also spelled as Shivratri, Shivarathri and Sivaratri."

      "2024 Chandra DarshanChandra Darshan is the first day of moon sighting after no moon day. In Hinduism, the new moon day is known as Amavasya and the first sighting of moon after new moon has religious significance. People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

Due to its timing special Darshan, which depicts Lord Krishna preparing for the upcoming Holi, is organized in Krishna temples.Phulera Dooj is also spelled as Phulera Duj or Phoolera Dooj.According to astrologically, Phulera Dooj is a day which is free from all defects or Dosha.

Not doing Parana within Dwadashi is similar to an offence.Parana should not be done during Hari Vasara. One should wait for Hari Vasara to get over before breaking the fast. Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna. If due to some reasons one is not able to break the fast during Pratahkal then one should do it after Madhyahna.At times Ekadashi fasting is suggested on two consecutive days. It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha. When alternate Ekadashi fasting is suggested for Smartha it coincides with Vaishnava Ekadashi fasting day.Ekadashi fasting on both days is suggested for staunch devotees who seek for love and affection of Lord Vishnu."

      "2024 Vasanta PurnimaThe full moon day which falls in the middle of spring season in India is known as Vasanta Purnima. Vasanta Purnima is very significant day as it coincides with the festival of colors i.e. Holi. As nature displays various colors during spring, Holi which is also the festival of colors synergizes with nature at the same time.It is believed that ritual of playing Holi with colors was started in the era of Lord Krishna. It was Lord Krishna who started playing Holi with Radha Rani and her female friends commonly known as Gopis. Vedic astronomy defines six seasons in a year and these seasons are known as Ritu. These six Ritu are-Vasanta - springGrishma - summerVarsha - monsoonSharad - autumnHemant - prewinterShishir - winterVasanta time in India usually starts on February 19 and ends on April 19. Hence all Hindu festivals which fall during this period are linked to Vasanta Ritu.As Phalguna Purnima falls in the middle of Vasanta Ritu, it is known as Vasanta Purnima. It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.Vasanta Panchami is good example to understand that Hindu festivals are not strictly linked with seasons. Half of the time Vasanta Panchami is observed before February 19 i.e. much before Vasanta Ritu starts. Hence Shri Panchami, which is alternate name of Vasanta Panchami, is better way to name the festival. However Vasanta Panchami heralds the arrival of Vasanta Ritu as well as Vasanta Purnima.Holi, which is observed during Phalguna Purnima, falls in middle of Vasanta Ritu. We can say that Holi is Vasanta festival and it would keep coinciding with Vasanta Ritu for thousands of years as drifting of festivals from seasons take thousands of years to make any significance difference.Holi Purnima, Phalguna Purnima and Vasanta Purnima all points to the same day in Hindu calendar. The day of Vasanta Purnima is also the birth anniversary of Goddess Lakshmi and Saint Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu."

The second day is known as Rangwali Holi - the day when people play with colored powder and colored water. Rangwali Holi which is main Holi day is also known as Dhulandi or Dhulendi (धुलण्डी). The other less popular pronunciations of Dhulandi are Dhuleti, Dhulheti.On first day bonfires are lit after sunset at Right Holika Dahan Muhurat. Main Holi day when people play with colors is always next day of Holika Dahan or Holi bonfire. Next day in the morning people play Holi with dry and wet colors. People are more willing and comfortable to play Holi with dry colored powders which are known as Gulal. However many people feel that Holi celebrations are incomplete without wet colors. Wet color is applied on the face and is made on the spot by mixing little amount of water with dry colored powder. More enthusiastic Holi folk mix dry colored powder in full bucket of water to drench complete body in wet color.Whole team of DrikPanchang.com wishes you Happy and Colorful Holi!"

This penumbral eclipse would not be complete as the penumbral shadow of the earth would cover only 95% of the moon during the maximum of the eclipse.The penumbral eclipse would be visible from most of Australia, Africa, North America, South America, Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, North-East parts of Asia and some western parts of Europe.None of the eclipse would be visible from India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and other countries in western Asia.Lisbon in Portugal,\nNew York City in USA,\nWashington D.C. in USA,\nMexico City in Mexico,\nAnadyr in Russia,\nHavana in Cuba,\nSantiago in Chile,\nLima in Peru,\nKingston in Jamaica,\nAuckland in New Zealand and\nSydney in Australia are some well known cities in the world, where Penumbral Lunar Eclipse will be visible.For more information on eclipse visibility please check Plot of Penumbral Lunar Eclipse of March 25, 2024.",
      "About Lunar Eclipse DataIf Lunar Eclipse starts before midnight but ends after midnight i.e. it covers two different dates on Gregorian calendar then the chosen Eclipse Day is when maximum of Lunar Eclipse occurs. Hence Penumbral Phase as well as Umbral Phase might start before midnight i.e. on the previous day.Moonrise and Moonset moments are corrected for Parallax and this correction gives better timings for the Eclipse sighting.Hinduism and Lunar EclipseUnless Lunar Eclipse is visible to the naked eye, it is of no significance to Hindus and Hindus don't consider it for any religious activities. Penumbral Lunar Eclipses are not visible to the naked eye hence no rituals related to Chandra Grahan should be observed. If Lunar Eclipse is visible during Umbral Phase then only it should be considered for religious activities. Most Hindu Calendars don't list Penumbral Eclipses.If Chandra Grahan is not visible in your city but it is visible some city near to that then you should not observe it. Precautions which are advised during Sutak should be taken only if Chandra Grahan is visible in your city. Chandra Grahan is considered even if the Moon is not visible due to cloudy weather or some other weather conditions."

Holi the one of the most significant and popular Hindu festivals is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The day also coincides with Lakshmi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity.Phalguna Purnima is also known as Vasanta Purnima, as this Purnima coincides with Vasanta Ritu out of total six Ritu(s) or seasons in Vedic astrology.

The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that of Holika Dahan but the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different than legend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed as Kaman Pandigai in Tamil Nadu and Kamuni Panduga in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.In West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnima is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated to Lord Krishna.

However both North Indian and South Indian observe it on the same day. Currently it falls in month of March or April in English calendar.",
      "Parana means breaking the fast. Ekadashi Parana is done after sunrise on next day of Ekadashi fast. It is necessary to do Parana within Dwadashi Tithi unless Dwadashi is over before sunrise. Not doing Parana within Dwadashi is similar to an offence.Parana should not be done during Hari Vasara. One should wait for Hari Vasara to get over before breaking the fast. Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna. If due to some reasons one is not able to break the fast during Pratahkal then one should do it after Madhyahna.At times Ekadashi fasting is suggested on two consecutive days. It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha. When alternate Ekadashi fasting is suggested for Smartha it coincides with Vaishnava Ekadashi fasting day.Ekadashi fasting on both days is suggested for staunch devotees who seek for love and affection of Lord Vishnu."

      "Pradosh Vrat, PradoshamFor Pradosham Vrat, day is fixed when Trayodashi Tithi falls during Pradosh Kaal which starts after Sunset. The time window after Sunset when Trayodashi Tithi and Pradosh time overlaps is auspicious for Shiva Puja. DrikPanchang.com lists this time for all Pradosham and this time should be preferred for doing Shiva Puja.Location based Pradosham DaysIt is important to understand that fasting day for Pradosham might differ for two cities even if those cities are within same Indian state. Fasting for Pradosham depends on sunset time and it is observed when Trayodashi Tithi prevails after sunset. Hence Pradosham fasting might be observed on Dwadashi Tithi i.e. one day before Trayodashi Tithi. As Sunset time is different for all cities, it is important to refer Hindu calendar like this website which lists location based Pradosham days. As generating location based dates are time consuming most sources ignore this fact and publish single list for all cities."

      "2024 Chaitra Navratri GhatasthapanaMost of the customs and rituals observed during Shardiya Navratri are also observed during Chaitra Navratri. Ghatasthapana Muhurta and Sandhi Puja Muhurta are more popular during Shardiya Navratri but these Muhurta(s) are also needed during Chaitra Navratri.Ghatasthapana is one of the significant rituals during Navratri. It marks the beginning of nine days festivity. Our scriptures have well defined rules and guidelines to perform Ghatasthapana during a certain period of time at the beginning of Navratri. Ghatasthapana is invocation of Goddess Shakti and doing it wrong time, as our scriptures forewarn, might bring wrath of the Goddess Shakti. Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.The most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done during Abhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoid Nakshatra Chitra and Vaidhriti Yoga during Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited. The most important factor to consider is that Ghatasthapana is done before Hindu midday while Pratipada is prevailing.DrikPanchang.com team takes care for all conditions and exceptions to find the best time to perform Ghatasthapana and we do it for 1,00,000+ cities all over the world (we also generate daily Panchangam data for 1,00,000+ cities). In other words we don't use Muhurta calculated for one city for any other city to make sure we consider all local factors like sunrise, sunset, midday, ascendant and last but not the least DST, if applicable.You will find many sources which advise to take Choghadiya Muhurta to do Ghatasthapana but our scriptures don't advise to take Choghadiya Muhurta. DrikPanchang.com team researches all authentic sources and follows only those rules which are well documented in Vedic scriptures. However if you want to choose Choghadiya Muhurta you can take it from Choghadiya page but we don't recommend it to use for Ghatasthapana.We also consider Lagna and try to include Dvi-Svabhava Lagna (द्वि स्वभाव लग्न) into calculated Muhurta. During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava Lagna Kanya prevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.The factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.Ghatasthapana is also known as Kalash Sthapana or Kalashsthapana.

People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

      "2024 Rama NavamiLord Rama was born on Navami Tithi during Shukla Paksha of Chaitra month. Each year this day is celebrated as birthday of Lord Rama. Lord Rama was born during Madhyahna period which is middle of Hindu day. Madhyahna which prevails for six Ghatis (approximately 2 hours and 24 minutes) is the most auspicious time to perform Rama Navami Puja rituals. The mid-point of Madhyahna marks the moment when Shri Rama was born and temples symbolize this moment as birth moment of Lord Rama. The chanting of Shri Rama and celebration reaches its peak during this time.Due to widespread use of western clock and Gregorian calendar people assume 12 p.m. as Madhyahna moment. This could have been correct if sunrise and sunset occur exactly at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. respectively but at most places sunrise and sunset timings are different from six O'clock. Hence the exact time to celebrate birthday of Lord Rama falls between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. for most Indian cities. DrikPanchang.com list Hindu midday moment for all cities and this moment should be used to mark the birth of Shri Rama.Ayodhya is birthplace of Lord Rama and Rama Navami celebrations in Ayodhya are remarkable. Devotees come to Ayodhya from far-flung places. After taking holy dip into river Sarayu Devotees visit Rama temple to participate in birthday celebrations.Eight Prahar fasting is suggested during Rama Navami. Which means devotes should observe the fast from sunrise to sunrise. Rama Navami Vrat can be observed in three different ways, casual (नैमित्तिक) -which can be observed without any cause, continual (नित्य) - which can be observed throughout life without any desire and desirable (काम्य) - which can be observed to fulfill any desire."

The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun.

It is believed that Parashurama was born during Pradosh Kala and hence the day when Tritiya prevails during Pradosh Kala is considered for Parashurama Jayanti celebrations. The purpose of the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu is to relieve the Earth's burden by exterminating the sinful, destructive and irreligious monarchs that pillaged its resources and neglected their duties as kings.According to Hindu belief unlike all other avatars Parashurama still lives on the Earth. Therefore, unlike Rama and Krishna, Parashurama is not worshipped. In South India, at the holy place Pajaka near Udupi, one major temple exists which commemorates Parashurama. There are many temples at the western coast of India which are dedicated to Lord Parashurama.The Kalki Purana states that Parashurama will be the martial guru of Shri Kalki, the 10th and final Avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is not the first time that 6th Avatar of Lord Vishnu will meet another Avatar. According to Ramayana, Parashurama came to the betrothal ceremony of Sita and Lord Rama and met the 7th Avatar of Lord Vishnu."

Later Lord Shiva released Ganga so that she can accomplish her mission to purge the cursed souls of Bhagiratha's ancestors.While on her way to kingdom of Bhagiratha, her mighty flow and gushing turbulent water destroyed the Ashram of sage Jahnu. This angered Sage Jahnu and he drank up all of Ganga's water. Upon this, Bhagiratha and the Gods prayed to Rishi Jahnu to release Ganga so that she could proceed on her mission. Pleased with prayers Jahnu released Ganga from his ear.According to legends Jahnu Rishi released Ganga from his ear on Saptami of Vaishakha Shukla Paksha. Because of this legend this day is also known as Jahnu Saptami. Ganga is also known as Jahnavi, the daughter of Rishi Jahnu.On Ganga Saptami devotees worship Goddess Ganga and take bath in Ganges. Taking bath in Ganges on Ganga Saptami day is considered highly auspicious."

Before coming to the Earth, the Goddess Ganga was residing in Kamandal of Lord Brahma and along with her the Goddess Ganga brought the purity of heaven to the Earth.On Ganga Dussehra devotees worship Goddess Ganga and take bath in Ganges. Taking bath in Ganges and offering charity or Dan-Punya (दान-पुण्य) on Ganga Dussehra day is considered highly auspicious. It is believed that holy dip in Ganges on Ganga Dussehra day can purge all type of sins.Devotees flock to Prayagraj/Allahabad, Garhmukteshwar, Haridwar, Rishikesh and Varanasi to take a holy dip. Ganga Dussehra celebrations are legendary in Varanasi. On Ganga Dussehra day thousands of devotees do Ganga Snan and participate in Ganga Aarti at Dasaswamedh Ghat.Ganga Dussehra should not be confused with Ganga Jayanti when the Goddess Ganga was reborn."

Nirjala Ekadashi Vratam is the toughest among all Ekadashi fasting due to strict fasting rules. Devotees abstain not only from food but also from water while observing Nirjala Ekadashi Vrat.Benefits - Devotees who are unable to observe all twenty fours Ekadashi fasting in a year should observe single Nirjala Ekadashi fasting as fasting on Nirjala Ekadashi brings all benefits of twenty four Ekadashi fasting in a year.Nirjala Ekadashi is also known as Pandava Ekadashi or Bhimseni Ekadashi or Bhima Ekadashi due to one legend associated with Nirjala Ekadashi. Bhimsen, the second Pandava brother and voracious eater, was not able to control his desire of having food and was not able observe Ekadashi fasting. Except Bhima, all Pandava brothers and Draupadi used to observe all Ekadashi fasting. Bhima, being upset due to his weak determination and doing a dishonor to Lord Vishnu, met Maharishi Vyasa to find some solution. Sage Vyasa advised Bhima to observe single Nirjala Ekadasi fasting to compensate for not observing all Ekadashi fasting in a year. Due to this legend Nirjala Ekadashi is also known as Bhimseni Ekadashi or Pandava Ekadashi.Time - Nirjala Ekadashi fasting falls during Shukla Paksha of Jyeshtha month and currently falls in month of May or June.

Ghatasthapana Muhurta is more popular during Shardiya Navratri but it is also needed during Ashadha Gupta Navratri.Ghatasthapana is one of the significant rituals during Navratri. It marks the beginning of the nine days Durga Puja. Our scriptures have well defined rules and guidelines to perform Ghatasthapana during a certain period of time at the beginning of Navratri. Ghatasthapana is invocation of Goddess Shakti and doing it wrong time, as our scriptures forewarn, might bring wrath of the Goddess Shakti. Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.The most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done during Abhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoid Nakshatra Chitra and Vaidhriti Yoga during Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited. The most important factor to consider is that Ghatasthapana is done before Hindu midday while Pratipada is prevailing.We also consider Lagna and try to include Dvi-Svabhava Lagna (द्वि स्वभाव लग्न) into calculated Muhurta. During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava Lagna Kanya prevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.The factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.Ghatasthapana is also known as Kalash Sthapana or Kalashsthapana.

      "Puri Ratha Yatra 2024Ratha Yatra is a huge Hindu festival and it is organized each year at famous Jagannatha temple in Puri, Odisha, India. Ratha Yatra day is decided based on Hindu Lunar calendar and it is fixed on Dwitiya Tithi during Shukla Paksha of Ashada month. Currently it falls in month of June or July in Gregorian calendar.Lord Jagannatha is worshipped primarily in city of Puri at famous Jagannatha temple. Lord Jagannatha is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and also revered by the followers of Vaishnavism. Jagannatha literally means Lord of the Universe. Jagannatha temple is one of the four Hindu pilgrimage centers known as Char Dham pilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime. Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra.Ratha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit to Gundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion of Queen Gundicha, wife of the legendary King Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युमना) who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.One day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known as Gundicha Marjana (मार्जन) and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.The fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated as Hera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी) when Goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.After resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known as Bahuda (बहुदा) Yatra or Return Yatra and is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage at Mausi Maa temple which is dedicated to Goddess Ardhashini.It should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just before Devshayani Ekadashi when Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known as Puri Car Festival among foreign visitors.It should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known as Snana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known as Jyestha Purnima."

In Hinduism, the new moon day is known as Amavasya and the first sighting of moon after new moon has religious significance. People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

      "2024 Kokila VratKokila Vrat is observed on Purnima during the lunar month of Ashadha. It is believed that Kokila Vrat should be observed in those years when there is an intercalary Ashadha month. In other words, Kokila Vrat should be observed only when Ashadha Masa is leaped. According to this belief, whenever Ashadha is leaped, Kokila Vrat should be observed during normal Masa and not during Adhik Masa. This belief is supported especially in North Indian states. However, in some regions, especially in Southern and Western parts of India, Kokila Vrat is performed annually on Ashadha Purnima.Kokila Vrat is dedicated to Goddess Sati and Lord Shiva. The name Kokila refers to Indian bird cuckoo and is associated with Goddess Sati. According to legends associated with Kokila Vrat, Goddess Sati immolated herself when Her father insulted Lord Shiva. After that, Goddess Sati spent 1000 celestial years as a cuckoo before she got back her shape and merged with Lord Shiva.Kokila Vrat is mainly observed by women. In some regions, the Vrat is observed for a month from Ashadha Purnima to Shravan Purnima. During Kokila fasting, women wake up early and take bath in nearby river or water body. After bath women make an idol of cuckoo with clay and worship it.It is believed that women who observe Kokila Vrat will be Akhand Saubhagyavati. In other words, those who keep Kokila fasting will never go through widowhood phase in her life and would always die before her husband. It is also believed that worshiping an idol of cuckoo made of clay during Kokila Vrat will help in getting loving and caring husband."

Not doing Parana within Dwadashi is similar to an offence.Parana should not be done during Hari Vasara. One should wait for Hari Vasara to get over before breaking the fast. Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna. If due to some reasons one is not able to break the fast during Pratahkal then one should do it after Madhyahna.At times Ekadashi fasting is suggested on two consecutive days. It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha. When alternate Ekadashi fasting is suggested for Smartha it coincides with Vaishnava Ekadashi fasting day.Ekadashi fasting on both days is suggested for staunch devotees who seek for love and affection of Lord Vishnu."

      "2024 Varalakshmi VratamAbout Goddess VaralakshmiVaralakshmi Puja day is one of the significant days to worship the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Varalakshmi, who is the consort of Lord Vishnu, is one of the forms of Goddess Mahalakshmi. Varalakshmi was incarnated from the milky ocean, popularly known as Kshir Sagar. She is described as having the complexion of milky ocean and adorns similar color clothes.It is believed that the Varalakshmi form of the goddess bestows boons and fulfills all desires of her devotees. Hence this form of the goddess is known as Vara + Lakshmi i.e. Goddess Lakshmi who bestows boons.About Varalakshmi VratThe Varalakshmi fasting is observed on the last Friday during Shravana Shukla Paksha and falls just few days ahead of Rakhi and Shravana Purnima.Varalakshmi Vrat is suggested not only for women but also for men. However, in Andhra, Telangana and Maharashtra regions, Varalakshmi fasting in mainly performed by married women only. The Varalakshmi fasting is performed with the desire of worldly pleasures and it includes children, spouse, luxury and all sorts of earthly pleasures.Varalakshmi Vratam is very popular fasting and Puja day in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. In these states, Varalakshmi Puja is performed mostly by married women for the well-being of husband and the other family members. It is believed that worshipping Goddess Vara-Lakshmi on this day is equivalent to worshipping Ashtalakshmi i.e. the eight Goddesses of Wealth (Sri), Earth (Bhu), Learning (Saraswati), Love (Priti), Fame (Kirti), Peace (Shanti), Pleasure (Tushti) and Strength (Pushti).However, in North Indian states Varalakshmi Puja is not as popular as those of South Indian states. Varalakshmi Vratam is one of the most appropriate days to propitiate and to seek blessings of the Goddess Lakshmi.Varalakshmi Puja MuhuratAs per Electional Astrology, the most appropriate time to worship Goddess Lakshmi is during fixed Lagna. It is believed that if Lakshmi Puja is done during fixed Lagna would bestow long-lasting prosperity.Hence we have given four Puja timing in a day when fixed Lagna prevails. Any suitable time can be chosen for Varalakshmi Puja. However, evening time which overlaps with Pradosh is considered the most appropriate to worship Goddess Lakshmi.Varalakshmi Puja VidhiThe Puja steps in Varalakshmi Puja Vidhi are similar to Maha Lakshmi Puja during Diwali. However it includes Puja steps and Mantra for Dorak and Vayana. The sacred thread which is tied during Varalakshmi Puja is known as Dorak and sweets offered to Varalakshmi is known as Vayana.Please check detailed Varalakshmi Puja Vidhi with all rituals as described in religious books."

      "2024 Shravana Putrada EkadashiPutrada Ekadashi is observed two times in a year. Ekadashi during Paush Shukla Paksha and Ekadashi during Shravan Shukla Paksha are known as Putrada Ekadashi.Paush Shukla Paksha Ekadashi currently falls in month of December or January while Shravan Shukla Paksha Ekadashi currently falls in month of July or August in English calendar. Putrada Ekadashi during Paush month is more popular in North Indian states while people in other states give more importance to Putrada Ekadashi during Shravana month.Benefits - Hinduism gives utmost importance to rituals performed at the time of the birth and the death. Hinduism prescribes certain rituals at the time of the death which should be performed by the son only. It is believed that funeral rites should be done by the son and it is must for the liberation of the soul. The son also performs duty of performing regular Shraddha to please the soul of the dead person either on the Earth or in the Heaven.Not conceiving a boy child becomes a misery for couples who believe in the \"life after death\" concept of Hinduism. It is advised that couples who wish to conceive a boy child should observe Putrada Ekadashi fasting.Shravan Shukla Paksha Ekadashi is also known as Pavitropana Ekadashi or Pavitra Ekadashi especially among Vaishnava community.",
      "Parana means breaking the fast. Ekadashi Parana is done after sunrise on next day of Ekadashi fast. It is necessary to do Parana within Dwadashi Tithi unless Dwadashi is over before sunrise. Not doing Parana within Dwadashi is similar to an offence.Parana should not be done during Hari Vasara. One should wait for Hari Vasara to get over before breaking the fast. Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna. If due to some reasons one is not able to break the fast during Pratahkal then one should do it after Madhyahna.At times Ekadashi fasting is suggested on two consecutive days. It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha. When alternate Ekadashi fasting is suggested for Smartha it coincides with Vaishnava Ekadashi fasting day.Ekadashi fasting on both days is suggested for staunch devotees who seek for love and affection of Lord Vishnu."

      "2024 Krishna JanmashtamiDevotees, who observe fast on Janmashtami, should have the only single meal a day before Janmashtami. On fasting day, devotees take Sankalpa to observe a day-long fast and to break it on the next day when both Rohini Nakshatra and Ashtami Tithi are over. Some devotees break the fast when either Rohini Nakshatra or Ashtami Tithi is over. Sankalpa is taken after finishing morning rituals and the day-long fasting begins with Sankalpa.The time to perform Krishna Puja is during Nishita Kaal which is the midnight as per Vedic time-keeping. Devotees perform detailed ritualistic Puja during midnight and it involves all sixteen steps which are part of Shodashopachara (षोडशोपचार) Puja Vidhi. Please check Krishna Janmashtami Puja Vidhi which lists all Puja steps for Janmashtami along with Vedic Mantra to perform the Puja.Fasting Rules on Krishna JanmashtamiNo grains should be consumed during Janmashtami fasting until the fast is broken on next day after Sunrise. All rules followed during Ekadashi fasting should be followed during Janmashtami fasting also.Parana which means breaking the fast should be done at an appropriate time. For Krishna Janmashtami fasting, Parana is done on next day after Sunrise when Ashtami Tithi and Rohini Nakshatra are over. If Ashtami Tithi and Rohini Nakshatra do not get over before Sunset then fast can be broken during the daytime when either Ashtami Tithi or Rohini Nakshatra is over. When neither Ashtami Tithi nor Rohini Nakshatra is over before Sunset or even Hindu Midnight (also known as Nishita Time) one should wait to get them over before breaking the fast.Depending on end timing of Ashtami Tithi and Rohini Nakshatra fasting on Krishna Janmashtami might continue for two complete days. Devotees who are not able to follow two days fasting might break the fast on next day after Sunrise. It has been suggested by Hindu religious text Dharmasindhu.Krishna Janmashtami is also known as Krishnashtami, Gokulashtami, Ashtami Rohini, Srikrishna Jayanti and Sree Jayanthi.",
      "About Two Krishna Janmashtami DatesMost of the time, Krishna Janmashtami is listed on two consecutive days. The first one is for Smarta Sampradaya and the other one is for Vaishanava Sampradaya. Vaishanava Sampradaya date is the latter one. A single date for Janmashtami means that both Sampradaya would observe Janmashtami on the same date.However many people will notice unanimity in North India on choosing the day to celebrate Krishna Janmashtami. The reason behind this unanimity is the institution of ISKCON. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, commonly known as ISKCON is founded on the principles of Vaishnava traditions and most followers of the ISKCON are the followers of Vaishnavism.With all due respect, ISKCON is one of the most commercialized and global religious institutions which spend money and resources to promote ISKCON brand and ISKCON culture. In North India, most people observe Janmashtami on the day chosen by ISKCON. Many people who are not the followers of Vaishnavism do not even understand that ISKCON traditions are different and the most appropriate day to observe Janmashtami fasting might not be the same as that of ISKCON.Smarta followers who understand the difference between Smarta and Vaishnava sectarian do not follow ISKCON date to observe Janmashtami fasting. Unfortunately, ISKCON date to observe Janmashtami is unanimously followed in Braj region and most common people who just follow the buzz observe it on the date followed by the ISKCON.People who are not the followers of Vaishnavism are followers of Smartism. Hindu religious texts like Dharmasindhu and Nirnaysindhu have well-defined rules to decide Janmashtami day and those rules should be followed to decide Janmashtami day if one is not the follower of Vaishnava Sampradaya. Ekadashi fasting is one of the good examples to understand this difference. Rules to observe Ekadashis' fasting are also different for Smarta and Vaishnava communities. However, there is more awareness about different Ekadashi rules followed by Vaishnava sectarian. Not only Ekadashis, Vaishnava fasting day for Janmashtami and Rama Navami might be one day later than Smarta fasting day.The followers of Vaishnavism give preference to Ashtami Tithi and Rohini Nakshatra. The followers of Vaishnavism never observe Janmashtami on Saptami Tithi. Janmashtami day according to Vaishnava rules always fall on Ashtami or Navami Tithi on Hindu calendar.However, rules followed by Smartism to decide Janmashtami day are more complex. The preference is given to Nishita Kaal or Hindu midnight. The preference is given to the day, either Saptami Tithi or Ashtami Tithi, when Ashtami Tithi prevails during Nishita and further rules are added to include Rohini Nakshatra. The final consideration is given to the day which has the most auspicious combination of Ashtami Tithi and Rohini Nakshatra during Nishita time. Janmashtami day according to Smarta rules always fall on Saptami or Ashtami Tithi on Hindu calendar.This page list Janmashtami according to Smarta Sampradaya as well as ISKCON."

      "Dahi Handi 2024Dahi Handi is a famous sportive event organized in the cities of Maharashtra and Goa. Dahi Handi is celebrated on the next day of Krishna Janmashtami. Krishna Janmashtami is also famous as Gokulashtami. Dahi translates to the curd and Handi translates to earthen pot used to process and keep the milk products. Dahi Handi celebration is also known as Gopalakala in Maharashtra.Dahi Handi celebration commemorates the way of living of Lord Krishna. In His childhood, young Krishna was very fond of the curd and the butter. While growing up the fondness of curd and the butter increased and young Krishna became notorious for stealing it.When Krishna and His troop started eyeing neighborhood homes to quench their thirst for milk products, female folks in the entire neighborhood became cautious and started hanging milk products from the ceiling like a chandelier. The idea was to take advantage of short height of young Krishna and His troop and keep Dahi Handis out of reach of small hands.To defeat the idea of female cowherds, Krishna devised the idea of forming human pyramid. Human pyramid was used as the ladder to climb up and reach the Handi. Since then it has become part of Indian folklore. Every year during Janmashtami this event from the life of Lord Krishna is played by the young troop of boys.To make the task challenging Handi is kept at several floors high at the open ground or at the street crossing. Dahi Handi could be up to  several floors high in the sky. Women folks who represent female cowherds from the tale of Lord Krishna thwart any attempts to create human pyramid by throwing the water or some slippery liquid on the pyramid formation.In Mumbai, Dahi Handi is getting emerged as a competitive sport. Hundreds of team participates every year in the event. Famous celebrities are invited to promote the event. In recent years the prize money has reached to one crore which is equivalent to 10 million of Indian Rupees.With time the whole event has its own slogan Govinda Aala Re!"

In Hinduism, the new moon day is known as Amavasya and the first sighting of moon after new moon has religious significance. People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

      "2024 Ganesh ChaturthiGanesh Chaturthi is celebrated as birth anniversary of Lord Ganesh. On Ganesh Chaturthi, Lord Ganesh is worshipped as the god of wisdom, prosperity and good fortune. It is believed that Lord Ganesh was born during Shukla Paksha of Bhadrapada month. Currently Ganesh Chaturthi day falls in month of August or September in English calendar.The Ganeshotsav, the festivity of Ganesh Chaturthi, ends after 10 days on Anant Chaturdashi which is also known as Ganesh Visarjan day. On Anant Chaturdashi, devotees immerse idol of Lord Ganesh in water body after a gala street procession.Ganapati Sthapana and Ganapati Puja MuhuratGanesh Puja is preferred during Madhyahna as it is believed that Lord Ganesh was born during Madhyahna Kala. Madhyahna Kala is equivalent to midday according to Hindu division of the day.As per Hindu time-keeping, the time duration between sunrise to sunset is divided into five equal parts. These five parts are known as Pratahkala, Sangava, Madhyahna, Aparahna and Sayankal. Ganapati Sthapana and Ganapati Puja on Ganesha Chaturthi are done during Madhyahna part of the day and as per Vedic astrology it is considered the most appropriate time for Ganesha Puja.During midday, Ganesha devotees perform detailed ritualistic Ganesha Puja which is known as Shodashopachara Ganapati Puja.Prohibited Moon Sighting on Ganesha ChaturthiIt is believed that one should not sight the moon on Ganesh Chaturthi. Sighting moon on Ganesh Chaturthi creates Mithya Dosham or Mithya Kalank (कलंक) which means false accusation of stealing something.As per Puranic legends, Lord Krishna was falsely accused of stealing precious jewel named Syamantaka. After seeing plights of Lord Krishna, Sage Narada informed that Lord Krishna sighted moon on the day of Bhadrapada Shukla Chaturthi and because of that he has been cursed with Mithya Dosha.Sage Narada further informed Lord Krishna that God Chandra has been cursed by Lord Ganesha that anyone who sighted moon on Shukla Chaturthi during Bhadrapada month would be cursed with Mithya Dosha and would be tainted and dishonoured in the society. On the advice of sage Narada Lord Krishna observed Ganesha Chaturthi fasting to get rid of Mithya Dosha.Mithya Dosha Prevention MantraDepending on start and end time of Chaturthi Tithi, sighting of moon might be prohibited for two consecutive days. According to DrikPanchang.com rules, Moon should not be sighted while Chaturthi Tithi is prevailing. Further, Moon risen during Chaturthi should not be sighted even if Chaturthi Tithi gets over before moonset.If anyone has mistakenly sighted moon on Ganesha Chaturthi then he should chant following Mantra to get rid of the curse – सिंहः प्रसेनमवधीत्सिंहो जाम्बवता हतः।सुकुमारक मारोदीस्तव ह्येष स्यमन्तकः॥Simhah Prasenamavadhitsimho Jambavata Hatah।  Sukumaraka Marodistava Hyesha Syamantakah॥Ganesh Chaturthi is also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi and Ganesh Chauth."

Currently Rishi Panchami day falls in August or September on English calendar.Rishi Panchami is not a festival but a fasting day observed by women to pay obeisance to the Sapta Rishis which means seven sages and to get purified from Rajaswala Dosha.Hinduism gives highest priority to purity and there are strict guidelines to maintain purity of the body and the soul. In Hinduism women are believed to be contaminated during their menstrual cycle. During menstrual cycle women are not allowed to enter in the kitchen for cooking, to participate in any religious activities and to touch any family members. Avoiding these guidelines creates Rajaswala Dosha. Rishi Panchami fasting is advised to get rid of Rajaswala Dosha.Rishi Panchami is more famous in Nepali Hindus. In some regions three days Hartalika Teej fasting ends on Rishi Panchami.Rishi Panchami is also known as Rushi Panchami."

Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna.

It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha.

      "2024 Vamana JayantiVamana Jayanti is celebrated as the birth anniversary of the Vamana Avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is observed on the Dwadashi Tithi of Bhadrapada Shukla Paksha. As per the Bhagwat Purana, Vamana was the fifth Avatar out of Dashavatara of Lord Vishnu and His first incarnation in the Treta Yuga. After the first four Avatars in the animal form, namely, Matsya (fish), Kurma (tortoise), Varaha (boar) and Narasimha (lion), Vamana was the first Avatar of Lord Vishnu in the human form. Vamana was born in Treta Yuga to Goddess Aditi and Rishi Kashyapa on the Dwadashi Tithi of Bhadrapada Shukla Paksha during Abhijit Muhurat when the Shravana Nakshatra was prevailing.Vamana Avatar LegendsLord Vishnu incarnated as Vamana to restore the reign of God Indra on Swarga Loka. King Bali, a great devotee of Lord Vishnu, overthrew Indra and established himself as the king of Swarga Loka. Despite being the Vishnu devotee and a munificent king, Bali was cruel and proud. He wielded his powers to threaten the Gods and Brahmins. By abusing his powers on Gods and Humans alike, the invincible king Bali expanded his kingdom and became the king of Swarga Loka, Bhu Loka and Patala Loka.Indra, after being dethroned from his own kingdom, along with other Deva approached Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu assured Indra by saying that He would take birth as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa, in the form of dwarf Brahmin to save the three Loka from the cruelties of Bali.Lord Vishnu, to fulfil His promise, incarnated as Vamana or a dwarf monk, approached King Bali where the later was performing Ashvamedha Yagya. Vamana asked 3 steps of land as Bhiksha from Bali, to which Bali readily agreed. Vamana immediately transformed into a gigantic form and measured the whole earth in one stride. In the second stride, He measured the heaven. When Vamana Dev was about to take the third step, Bali realized that the dwarf monk was no other than Lord Vishnu Himself and for the third stride, offered his head. To honor the benevolence of His devotee, instead of killing Bali, Lord Vishnu pushed him to the Patala Loka or netherworld. Lord Vishnu also granted a boon to Bali, which allowed him to visit his subjects on Earth once a year. The annual homecoming of king Bali is celebrated in Kerala on Onam and in rest of the country on Bali Pratipada.Vamana Jayanti Puja VidhiOn the day of Vamana Jayanti, Lord Vishnu is worshipped in his Vamana Avatar. On this day, Panchopachara or Shodashopachara Puja of golden or clay idol of Vamana is performed in the morning. Fast is also observed on Vamana Jayanti. After performing the Puja in the evening, Vamana Jayanti Vrat Katha is narrated and the fast is broken with Prasad. Donation of rice, curd and Mishri is also given on this day. The significance of Vamana Jayanti increases multiple times if it coincides with the Shravana Nakshatra.Vamana Jayanti is also known as Vamana Dwadashi."

DrikPanchang.com lists this time for all Pradosham and this time should be preferred for doing Shiva Puja.Location based Pradosham DaysIt is important to understand that fasting day for Pradosham might differ for two cities even if those cities are within same Indian state. Fasting for Pradosham depends on sunset time and it is observed when Trayodashi Tithi prevails after sunset. Hence Pradosham fasting might be observed on Dwadashi Tithi i.e. one day before Trayodashi Tithi. As Sunset time is different for all cities, it is important to refer Hindu calendar like this website which lists location based Pradosham days.

However, Ganesha Visarjan on the same day of Ganesha Chaturthi is less popular.One and Half Day Ganesha VisarjanGanesha Visarjan which is done on the next day of Ganesha Chaturthi is known as one and half day Ganesha Visarjan. It is also one of the popular days to perform Ganesha Visarjan.Ganesha devotees, who do Visarjan on the next day of Ganesha Chaturthi, perform Ganesha Puja during afternoon and take the Ganapati idols for Visarjan after Madhyahna which is equivalent to midday as per Hindu division of the day.As the installation of Ganesha idol was done on previous day during Madhyahna and is taken out for Visarjan on the next day during second half of the day, this type of Visarjan is known as one and half day Ganesha Visarjan.3rd Day Visarjan, 5th Day Visarjan and 7th Day Ganesha VisarjanAlthough the day of Anant Chaturdashi is the most significant day to perform Ganesha Visarjan, many families do it on the 3rd or 5th or 7th day from the day of Ganesha Chaturthi. It is important to note that all these days are in odd numbers. Even the most important day of Ganesha Visarjan, which falls on Anant Chaturdashi day, is the 11th day from the day of Ganesha Chaturthi.Ganesha Visarjan on Anant ChaturdashiAnant Chaturdashi is the most significant day for Ganesha Visarjan. Apart from Ganesha Visarjan, Anant Chaturdashi is very significant day to worship Lord Vishnu in Anant form. Devotees of Lord Vishnu observe a day long fast and tie sacred thread during Puja. It is believed that sacred thread protects devotees from all sorts of trouble.Ganeshotsav or Ganesh-Utsav, which begins on Ganesha Chaturthi, culminates on Anant Chaturdashi. Hence Ganeshotsav is celebrated for 10 days in the month of Bhadrapada. The last day of festivity is known as Ganesha Visarjan. Ganesha Visarjan is also known as Vinayaka Nimajjanam in Telugu speaking regions.On the eleventh day the statue of Lord Ganesha is immersed into water body, preferably in a river, lake or the sea. After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through the street procession with much fanfare. Thousands of devotees join the procession and fill the whole atmosphere with chanting of Lord Ganesha. \"Ganapati Bappa Morya\" and \"Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai\" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.In Mumbai, Ganesha Visarjan is performed under the guidance of Ganpati Mandals. The street procession is accompanied with Dhol, Tasha and the other traditional instruments. Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.Few families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition. The idol of Lord Ganesha can be immersed in the water of tub or bucket."

      "About Lunar Eclipse DataIf Lunar Eclipse starts before midnight but ends after midnight i.e. it covers two different dates on Gregorian calendar then the chosen Eclipse Day is when maximum of Lunar Eclipse occurs. Hence Penumbral Phase as well as Umbral Phase might start before midnight i.e. on the previous day.Moonrise and Moonset moments are corrected for Parallax and this correction gives better timings for the Eclipse sighting.Hinduism and Lunar EclipseUnless Lunar Eclipse is visible to the naked eye, it is of no significance to Hindus and Hindus don't consider it for any religious activities. Penumbral Lunar Eclipses are not visible to the naked eye hence no rituals related to Chandra Grahan should be observed. If Lunar Eclipse is visible during Umbral Phase then only it should be considered for religious activities. Most Hindu Calendars don't list Penumbral Eclipses.If Chandra Grahan is not visible in your city but it is visible some city near to that then you should not observe it. Precautions which are advised during Sutak should be taken only if Chandra Grahan is visible in your city. Chandra Grahan is considered even if the Moon is not visible due to cloudy weather or some other weather conditions."

      "Purnima Fasting or Pournami VrathamPurnima fasting on Chaturdashi occurs only when Purnima starts during Madhyahna period on previous day. It is believed that if Chaturdashi prevails beyond Madhyahna then it pollutes Purnima Tithi and this Chaturdashi day should not be considered for Purnima fasting even if Purnima prevails during evening. There are no two opinions on this rule and DrikPanchang.com lists Purnima fasting days according to this rule.In North India full moon day is known as Purnima or Poornima. However in South India full moon day is known as Pournami or Pournima and fasting on this day is known as Pournami Vratam. Pournami Vratam is observed from sunrise to till sighting of the moon.Pournami Fasting days might not be same for two locations. Hence one should set the location before noting down Pournami Vratam dates."

Fasting for Pradosham depends on sunset time and it is observed when Trayodashi Tithi prevails after sunset. Hence Pradosham fasting might be observed on Dwadashi Tithi i.e. one day before Trayodashi Tithi. As Sunset time is different for all cities, it is important to refer Hindu calendar like this website which lists location based Pradosham days.

      "2024 Shardiya Navratri | Ashwina NavratriNavratri is a nine days festival dedicated to Goddess Durga. Navratri is a Sanskrit word which literally means nine nights. During these nine nights and ten days, Goddess Durga is worshipped in 9 different forms, known as Navdurga. The tenth day is celebrated as Vijayadashami when idols of Goddess Durga are immersed into the water body.Navratri is celebrated in most Indian states. However Navratri is very popular festival in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and the southern state of Karnataka. On the very first day of Navratri, Goddess Durga is invoked into a Kalash with full Vedic rituals along with chanting of Mantras. The invocation and dwelling of Goddess Durga into the Kalash is known as Ghatasthapana or Kalashsthapana and is done at an appropriate time of the day.In West Bengal Navratri is celebrated as Durga Puja. In West Bengal, Goddess Durga is worshipped on the last three days of Navratri and these three days are famously known as Durga Saptami, Durga Ashtami and Durga Navami. It would be correct to say that Durga Puja in West Bengal is a smaller version of 9 days Navratri. Kalparambha and Bilva Nimantran during Durga Puja, which is done on the sixth day of Navratri, is symbolically same as Ghatasthapana or Kalashsthapana in other states.Hindu religious books suggest 7 days Navratri, 5 days Navratri, 3 days Navratri, 2 days Navratri or even 1 day Navratri as an alternative to 9 days Navratri.Jyoti Kalash, Kumari Puja, Sandhi Puja, Navami Homa, Lalitha Vrat and Chandi Path are other famous rituals and events which are observed during 9 days Navratri."

      "2024 Shardiya Navratri GhatasthapanaGhatasthapana is one of the significant rituals during Navratri. It marks the beginning of nine days festivity. Our scriptures have well defined rules and guidelines to perform Ghatasthapana during a certain period of time at the beginning of Navratri. Ghatasthapana is invocation of Goddess Shakti and doing it wrong time, as our scriptures forewarn, might bring wrath of the Goddess Shakti. Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.The most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done during Abhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoid Nakshatra Chitra and Vaidhriti Yoga during Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited. The most important factor to consider is that Ghatasthapana is done before Hindu midday while Pratipada is prevailing.DrikPanchang.com team takes care for all conditions and exceptions to find the best time to perform Ghatasthapana and we do it for 1,00,000+ cities all over the world (we also generate daily Panchangam data for 1,00,000+ cities). In other words we don't use Muhurta calculated for one city for any other city to make sure we consider all local factors like sunrise, sunset, midday, ascendant and last but not the least DST, if applicable.You will find many sources which advise to take Choghadiya Muhurta to do Ghatasthapana but our scriptures don't advise to take Choghadiya Muhurta. DrikPanchang.com team researches all authentic sources and follows only those rules which are well documented in Vedic scriptures. However if you want to choose Choghadiya Muhurta you can take it from Choghadiya page but we don't recommend it to use for Ghatasthapana.We also consider Lagna and try to include Dvi-Svabhava Lagna (द्वि स्वभाव लग्न) into calculated Muhurta. During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava Lagna Kanya prevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.The factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.Ghatasthapana is also known as Kalash Sthapana or Kalashsthapana.

People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

Durga Puja on Maha Ashtami begins with Mahasnan and Shodashopachar Puja (षोडशोपचार पूजा) which is very much similar to Maha Saptami Puja except Prana Pratishtha (प्राण प्रतिष्ठा) which is done only once on Maha Saptami.On Maha Ashtami nine small pots are installed and nine Shaktis of Durga are invoked in them. All nine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Maha Ashtami Puja.Young unmarried girls, being treated as Goddess Durga itself, are also worshipped on Maha Ashtami. Worshipping of young girls during Durga Puja is known as Kumari Puja. In many regions Kumari Puja is done during all nine days of Durga Navratri. Kumari Puja on a single day during Durga Puja is preferred on Maha Ashtami.The legendary Sandhi Puja is also falls on Maha Ashtami. The time window of the last 24 minutes of Ashtami Tithi and the first 24 minutes of Navami Tithi is known as Sandhi Time or the holy juncture during Durga Puja. Sandhi time is considered the most auspicious time during whole Durga Puja. Sandhi Puja is the culmination point and the most important ritual of Durga Puja. It is customary to perform Balidan or animal sacrifice at this sacred juncture. Devotees who abstain from animal sacrifice perform symbolic Bali with vegetables like banana, cucumber or pumpkin. For Brahmins any type of animal sacrifice is prohibited by scriptures and Brahmin community does only symbolic Bali. Even the famous Belur Math in West Bengal does symbolic Bali with banana during Sandhi Puja. It is customary to light 108 earthen lamps during Sandhi Kaal."

      "2024 Kojagara Vratam, Kojagari PujaKojagara Vrat is one of the major festivals celebrated in West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. A special worship of Goddess Lakshmi is performed on this day. In this fast, there is a tradition of keeping vigil (Jagarana) at night. According to the Kojagara Vrat Story, Goddess Lakshmi visits the world on the night of Ashwin Purnima and She bestows wealth and prosperity on those devotees who are awakened on this night.Due to keeping Jagarana during the night, this fast is known as Kojagara Vrat. This fast is observed on the day of Ashwin Purnima. This fast is also known by the names Kojagari Puja, Bengali Lakshmi Puja etc. The full moon of Ashwin month is also called Kaumudi. Hence, one name of this fast is also Kaumudi Vrat. According to Skandapuran, Kojagara Vrat is the best fast, by observing which even an ordinary being attains the highest position and gets opulence, health and children in this birth and in other births also.The day when Purnima is Nishithvyapini, that day is considered best for Kojagara puja.Kojagara Puja Purnima is more famously known as Sharad Purnima in most parts of India. However, most people in India worship Goddess Lakshmi on Amavasya Tithi during Diwali.Importance Of Kojagara VratamKojagara Puja Mahatamya is described by Valakhilya Rishi -The disciples of sage Valakhilya asked, describe the Upangvratas of Kartik, by observing which fast of Kartika gets completed. Valakhilya said that, on the Shuklapaksha Purnima of Ashwin month, one should worship Lakshmi Ji with devotion at night. On this day, Goddess Lakshmi is pleased by drinking coconut water and playing the game of Chausar. On the night of Kojagara Puja, Goddess Lakshmi comes to visit the earth to give boons to the devotees who are doing Jagrana. All the devotees who are surrounded by poverty must observe this fast because a poor Brahmin named Valit also became very rich by observing this fast.The sages asked, who was Valit and where did he get the money from? Please describe this story in detail.Kojagara Puja Vrat KathaA Brahmin named Valit lived in the country of Magadha. Although he was rich in much knowledge and used to perform Sandhya Snana daily, but financially he was very poor. If someone came to donate something to him at home, he would accept it, otherwise he would not go to ask for anything from anyone.To read in detail, please click on Kojagara Vrat Katha."

      "2024 Sharad PurnimaSharad Purnima is one of the most famous Purnima(s) in Hindu Calendar. It is believed that Sharad Purnima is the only day in the year when the moon comes out with all sixteen Kala(s). In Hinduism, each human quality is associated with certain Kala and it is believed that the combination of sixteen different Kala(s) creates a perfect human personality. It was Lord Krishna who was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and He was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Rama was born with only twelve Kala(s).Hence, worshipping God Chandra on the day of Sharad Purnima is considered very significant. Newly wed women, who take pledge to do Purnimasi fasting for the year, begin the fast from the day of Sharad Purnima. In Gujarat Sharad Purnima is more popularly known as Sharad Poonam.On this day not only Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s) but also its rays have certain healing properties which nourish the body and the soul. It is also believed that the moon rays on the day of Sharad Purnima drip nectar. Hence to take advantage of this divine phenomenon, traditionally on the day of Sharad Purnima, Rice-Kheer a famous Indian sweet dish made of cow milk, rice and sugar, is prepared and left in moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, Rice-Kheer which is believed to be invigorated and fortified with the moonlight is consumed and distributed as Prasad in family members.In Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known as Raas Purnima (रास पूर्णिमा). It is believed that on the day of Sharad Purnima Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love. On the night of Sharad Purnima, upon hearing the divine music of Krishna's flute, Gopis of Vrindavan sneaked away from their homes and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night. It was the day when Lord Krishna created several of Krishna(s) to accompany each Gopi. It is believed that Lord Krishna supernaturally stretched the night to the length of one night of Lord Brahma which was equivalent of billions of human years.In many regions Sharad Purnima is known as Kojagara Purnima when Kojagara Vrat is observed for the whole day. Kojagara Vrat is also known as Kaumudi Vrat (कौमुदी व्रत)."

The fasting of Karwa Chauth and its rituals are observed by married women for the long life of their husband. Married women worship Lord Shiva and His family including Lord Ganesha and break the fast only after sighting and making the offerings to the moon. The fasting of Karwa Chauth is strict and observed without taking any food or even a drop of water after sunrise till the sighting of the moon in the night.Karwa Chauth day is also known as Karak Chaturthi (करक चतुर्थी). Karwa or Karak refers to the earthen pot through which water offering, known as Argha (अर्घ), is made to the moon. Karwa is very significant during Puja and it is also given as Dan to the Brahmin or any eligible woman.Compare to South Indian states, Karwa Chauth is more popular in North Indian states. After four days of Karwa Chauth, Ahoi Ashtami Vrat is observed for the wellbeing of sons."

On the day of Dhantrayodashi, Goddess Lakshmi came out of the ocean during the churning of the Milky Sea. Hence, Goddess Lakshmi, along with Lord Kubera who is the God of wealth, is worshipped on the auspicious day of Trayodashi. However, Lakshmi Puja on Amavasya after two days of Dhantrayodashi is considered more significant.Lakshmi Puja on Dhanteras or Dhantrayodashi should be done during Pradosh Kaal which starts after sunset and approximately lasts for 2 hours and 24 minutes.We don't advise to choose Choghadiya Muhurat to perform Dhanteras Puja as those Muhurtas are good only for travelling. The best time for Lakshmi Puja on Dhanteras is during Pradosh Kaal when Sthir Lagna prevails. Sthir means fixed i.e. not moveable. If Dhanteras Puja is done during Sthir Lagna, Lakshmiji will stay in your home; hence this time is the best for Dhanteras Pujan. Vrishabha Lagna is considered as Sthir and mostly overlaps with Pradosh Kaal during Diwali festivity.We provide exact window for Dhanteras Puja. Our Muhurat times contain Pradosh Kaal and Sthir Lagna while Trayodashi is prevailing. We provide Muhurat based on location, hence you should select your city first before noting down Shubh Dhanteras Puja timings.Dhanteras Puja is also known as Dhantrayodashi. The day of Dhanteras is also observed as Dhanwantari Triodasi or Dhanvantri Jayanti, the birth anniversary of the God of Ayurveda. Yamadeep is another ritual on the same Trayodashi Tithi when the lamp for the God of death is lit outside home to ward off any untimely death of any family members.The whole team of www.drikpanchang.com wishes you happy and prosperous Dhantrayodashi."

Some sources propose Mahanishita Kaal also to perform Lakshmi Puja. In our opinion Mahanishita Kaal is best suited for Tantrik community and practicing Pandits who know the best about Lakshmi Puja during this special time. For common people we propose Pradosh Kaal Muhurat.We don't advise to choose Choghadiya Muhurat to perform Lakshmi Puja as those Muhurtas are good only for travelling. The best time for Lakshmi Puja is during Pradosh Kaal when Sthir Lagna prevails. Sthir means fixed i.e. not moveable. If Lakshmi Puja is done during Sthir Lagna, Lakshmiji will stay in your home; hence this time is the best for Lakshmi Pujan. Vrishabha Lagna is considered as Sthir and mostly overlaps with Pradosh Kaal during Diwali festivity.We provide exact window for Lakshmi Puja. Our Muhurat times contain Pradosh Kaal and Sthir Lagna while Amavasya is prevailing. We provide Muhurat based on location, hence you should select your city first before noting down Shubh Lakshmi Puja timings.Many communities especially Gujarati businessmen do Chopda Pujan during Diwali Puja. During Chopda Puja new account books are inaugurated in presence of Goddess Lakshmi to seek Her blessing for the next financial year. Diwali Puja is also known as Deepavali Puja and Lakshmi Ganesh Pujan.The whole team of www.drikpanchang.com wishes you happy and prosperous Diwali 2024."

On this day food made of cereals like wheat, rice, curry made of gram flour and leafy vegetables is cooked and offered to Lord Krishna.In Maharashtra the same day is celebrated as Bali Pratipada or Bali Padva. The day commemorates victory of Vamana, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, over King Bali and subsequent pushing of Bali to Patal Lok (the underworld). It is believed that due to boon given by Lord Vamana, Asura King Bali visits the Prithvi Lok from the Patala Lok on this day.Most of the time Govardhan Puja day coincides with Gujarati New Year day, which is celebrated on Shukla Paksha Pratipada of Kartik month.

      "2024 Diwali Dyuta KridaThe act of gambling is known in Hinduism since Vedic period. However, it was known as game of Dyuta and called Dyuta-Krida (द्यूत-क्रीडा). The board on which it is played is known as Chaupar and dice are known as Pasha (पाश). In modern India, the game of dice is known as Jua (जुआ) and it is taboo to play Jua in many families. Most states in India have banned all sorts of gambling activities. However, many families play it during Diwali for religious reasons.It is believed that the game of dice was invented by Lord Shiva itself and it was played between Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati the very first time. It was stated by Lord Shiva to Goddess Parvati, \"O Devi! I have created the game of dice for those who want to play it for time pass, for those who want to amass sudden wealth and to destroy the wealth of someone\".As per Hindu religious books, it was the day of Kartik Pratipada when Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati played the game of dice the very first time. It is believed that the day of Kartik Pratipada, which is also known as Bali Pratipada and Govardhan Puja, is blessed by Goddess Parvati herself. Hence whoever plays Dyuta Krida on this day is blessed by Goddess Parvati.Dyuta Krida is a must ritual on the day of Kartik Pratipada which is also the first day of Hindu Samvat year and known as Gujarati New Year. The best time to play Dyuta is early morning during Pratahkal. As per religious books, wearing new clothes after Abhyang Snan on the first day of Kartik month should be followed by Dyuta Krida and taking Mangal Aarti from female members of the family.Many people play Dyuta on Diwali night which has no religious significance. None of the religious books mention gambling on Diwali night. However, most of them unanimously suggest playing Dyuta on the day of Kartik Pratipada. Also most of the people believe that Diwali day is an auspicious day for gambling and whoever gambles on this day wins. We all know that it cannot be correct as someone has to lose for someone to win in the game of dice. The reason, why religious books suggest playing Dyuta, is not that it is an auspicious day to win but it is the day to forecast for the coming year. If someone wins in the game of Dyuta on Kartik Pratipada then the whole year would be good for that person and if someone loses then it is omen of bad luck in coming year."

People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."

Hence for Chaturvedi community Diwali rituals continue till Dashami Tithi and beyond that.Next day of Kansa Vadh coincides with Dev Uthan Ekadashi day.

Fasting for Pradosham depends on sunset time and it is observed when Trayodashi Tithi prevails after sunset. Hence Pradosham fasting might be observed on Dwadashi Tithi i.e. one day before Trayodashi Tithi. As Sunset time is different for all cities, it is important to refer Hindu calendar like this website which lists location based Pradosham days.

      "2024 Vaikuntha ChaturdashiVaikuntha Chaturdashi is a holy day in Hindu calendar which is observed one day before of Kartik Purnima. The Shukla Paksha Chaturdashi during Kartik month is considered sacred for the devotees of Lord Vishnu as well as Lord Shiva because both deities are worshipped together on the same day. Otherwise, it is very rare that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu are worshipped together on the same day.Most of the temples in Varanasi observe Vaikuntha Chaturdashi and it falls one day before of another significant ritual of Dev Diwali. Apart from Varanasi, Vaikuntha Chaturdashi is also observed in Rishikesh, Gaya and many cities in Maharashtra.According to Shiva Purana, on the auspicious day of Kartik Chaturdashi, Lord Vishnu went to Varanasi to worship Lord Shiva. Lord Vishnu pledged to worship Lord Shiva with a thousand lotuses. While offering lotus flowers, Lord Vishnu found that the thousandth lotus was missing. To fulfil and complete His Puja Lord Vishnu, whose eyes are compared to lotuses, plucked one of His eyes and offered to Lord Shiva in place of the missing thousandth lotus flower. This devotion of Lord Vishnu pleased Lord Shiva so much that He not only restored the plucked eye of Lord Vishnu but also He rewarded Lord Vishnu with the gift of Sudarshana Chakra which became one of the most powerful and sacred weapons of Lord Vishnu.On Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, Lord Vishnu is worshipped during Nishitha which is the midnight as per Hindu division of the day. Devotees offer Lord Vishnu a thousand lotuses while reciting the Vishnu Sahasranama, the thousand names of Lord Vishnu.Although both Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva are worshipped on the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, the devotees perform Puja on two different timings of the day. The devotees of Lord Vishnu prefer Nishitha which is Hindu midnight while the devotees of Lord Shiva prefer Arunodaya which is Hindu dawn for the Puja. For the devotees of Shiva, the early morning bath during Arunodaya at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is very significant and this holy dip is known as Manikarnika Snan on Kartik Chaturdashi.This is the only day when Lord Vishnu is given a special place of honour in the sanctum of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, a prominent Lord Shiva temple in Varanasi. It is believed that the Vishwanath temple becomes as pious as Vaikuntha on the very same day. Both deities are ritually worshipped as though they are worshipping each other. Lord Vishnu offers Tulasi leaves to Shiva and Lord Shiva, in turn, offers Bael leaves to Lord Vishnu."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names of Lord Krishna.In Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day of Sharad Purnima and ends on Kartik Purnima.Kartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.Tulasi-Vivah Utsav which begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivah can be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals of Goddess Tulasi and Lord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.Bhishma Panchaka fasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well as Vishnu Panchaka.Vaikuntha Chaturdashi fasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i.e. one day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.Dev Diwali which is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Shiva killed demon Tripurasura on the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima and Tripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

It is the next Ekadashi after Devutthana Ekadashi.Utpanna Ekadashi is one of the significant Ekadashis as it is associated with the origin of Ekadashi fasting. All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated to Goddess Ekadashi who is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu. Goddess Vaishnavi is another power of Lord Vishnu and part of Sapta Matrika.Hence Utpanna Ekadashi is considered the birth anniversary of Ekadashi. Devotees, who pledge to observe yearly fasting, begin Ekadashi fasting from Utpanna Ekadashi.",
      "Parana means breaking the fast. Ekadashi Parana is done after sunrise on next day of Ekadashi fast. It is necessary to do Parana within Dwadashi Tithi unless Dwadashi is over before sunrise. Not doing Parana within Dwadashi is similar to an offence.Parana should not be done during Hari Vasara. One should wait for Hari Vasara to get over before breaking the fast. Hari Vasara is first one fourth duration of Dwadashi Tithi. The most preferred time to break the fast is Pratahkal. One should avoid breaking the fast during Madhyahna. If due to some reasons one is not able to break the fast during Pratahkal then one should do it after Madhyahna.At times Ekadashi fasting is suggested on two consecutive days. It is advised that Smartha with family should observe fasting on first day only. The alternate Ekadashi fasting, which is the second one, is suggested for Sanyasis, widows and for those who want Moksha. When alternate Ekadashi fasting is suggested for Smartha it coincides with Vaishnava Ekadashi fasting day.Ekadashi fasting on both days is suggested for staunch devotees who seek for love and affection of Lord Vishnu."

In Hinduism, the new moon day is known as Amavasya and the first sighting of moon after new moon has religious significance. People observe a day long fast and break it after sighting new moon on Chandra Darshan day.Predicting the first day of Chandra Darshan is always a challenging task for Panchang makers. The moon is visible only for a short span of time on the first day of Chandra Darshan and that is just after the sunset. In other words, the moon sets about one hour after sunset and can be sighted only after sunset due to being in the same horizon as that of the sun. Hence the moon can be sighted only after the sunset, when it is also going to be set."
